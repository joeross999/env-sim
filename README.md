## Environment Simulation

This is a personal currently in a very early stage of development.  It is intended to be a 2d environment for the simulation of the genetics of animals living in the environment. 

> This is my first project using React.js and TypeScript and I have been really enjoying working with both technologies and hope to grow better at them through continued use.

> Note: Forgive the styling of the project, that will come later.
